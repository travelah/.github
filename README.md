# Travelah: Your Ultimate Travel Buddy!
Indonesia is quickly becoming one of the hottest travel destinations in the world. The country is known for its vibrant culture, breathtaking landscapes, and friendly locals. According to data from the UNWTO, about 603 million domestic trips were made in Indonesia in 2021. Domestic travel in Indonesia increased compared to the year before. However, with so many places to visit and things to do, planning a trip can be overwhelming, especially for travelers looking to explore the country's hidden gems. To address this issue, we proposed to make the AI Virtual Tour Guide app to provide a personalized travel experience in Indonesia. The AI Virtual Tour Guide app offers a unique and personalized way to experience Indonesia's tourist spots, eliminating the need for generic tour guides or hours of internet research. This app has two main features, the first is an AI Virtual Guide chatbot who will recommend an itinerary list to the place you plan to visit, based on your preference and your taste. Second, is a community thread forum where users can share their travel experiences, tips, and recommendations with fellow users.  And the final apps, we successfully implemented those two features.
